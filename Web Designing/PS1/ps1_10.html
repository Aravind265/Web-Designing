        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by</p>
        <p>technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the</p>
        <p>structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

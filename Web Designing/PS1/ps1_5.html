        <h4 align="center"><u>-Stephaine Garber</u></h4>
        Scarlett Dragna has never left the <i><b>tiny</b></i> island where she and her sister, Tella, live with their <i><b>powerful</b></i>, and <i><b>cruel</b></i>, father. Now Scarlett’s father has arranged a marriage for her, and Scarlett thinks her dreams of seeing Caraval—the faraway, once-a-year performance where the audience participates in the show—are over.

But this year, Scarlett’s long-dreamt-of invitation finally arrives. With the help of a <i><b>mysterious</b></i> sailor, Tella whisks Scarlett away to the show. Only, as soon as they arrive, Tella is kidnapped by Caraval’s <i><b>mastermind</b></i> organizer, Legend. It turns out that this season’s Caraval revolves around Tella, and whoever finds her first is the winner.

Scarlett has been told that everything that happens during Caraval is only an <i><b>elaborate</b></i> performance. Nevertheless she becomes enmeshed in a game of love, heartbreak, and magic.
